# Introduction  

## ðŸ‘‹ About Me  
Hello! I am **John Louie V. Adornado**, a **21-year-old** **third-year Computer Engineering student** with a strong passion for learning. I am currently exploring the **computer vision** through the **Computer Vision Crash Course**, where I am developing my skills in image processing, facial recognition, and deep learning applications.  
 
My primary areas of interest in my program includes:  
- **Computer Vision & Image Processing** ðŸ“¸  
- **Machine Learning & AI** ðŸ¤–  
- **Predictive Analytics & Data Science** ðŸ“Š  

## ðŸ“š Current Project  
I am currently working on a **Face Recognition System** utilizing **OpenCV and Haar Cascades** in **VS Code**. This system involves:  
- **Training a model (`face_train.py`)** to recognize faces  
- **Testing (`face_test.py`)** the trained model  
- **Implementing real-time recognition (`face_recognition.py`)**  

This project aims to deepen my understanding of **facial recognition algorithms** and their applications in security, authentication, and smart surveillance systems.
